# Bread Clicker

**Bread Clicker** â€“ This is my second game developed in Unity. Working on this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of game mechanics, user interface systems, and player progression design.


## Project Description
Bread Clicker is a 2D incremental clicker game where players collect bread by clicking, purchase upgrades, and automate production to maximize efficiency. The game features various upgrades, passive income mechanics, and a dynamic interface for tracking progress.


## What I Learned
During this project, I developed the following skills:

- Designing and scaling UI systems in Unity, including Scroll View and dynamic text updates.
- Writing modular and reusable scripts in C# for mechanics like upgrades, auto-clickers, and resource management.
- Implementing save and load functionality using PlayerPrefs to persist player progress.
- Creating and balancing progression systems, including cost scaling and production bonuses.
- Adding tooltips and interactivity to enhance the user experience.
- Organizing larger projects and utilizing version control systems with GitHub.

## Technologies
- **Unity**: Used for game development and 2D design.
- **C#**: Used for implementing game logic and interaction.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and project management.


## How to Play
1. Click on the screen to collect bread.
2. Spend bread to buy upgrades like auto-clickers, bakeries, and factories.
3. Gradually increase production by purchasing higher-tier items.
4. Enjoy passive income as upgrades automate your production.


## Notes
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of game development, especially in creating progression systems and scaling dynamic UI elements. It represents an important step forward in my journey as a game developer.
