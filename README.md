# Bread Clicker

"Bread Clicker" â€“ This is my second project developed in Unity, aimed at improving my skills in game mechanics, UI systems, and player progression design.

## Project Description
"Bread Clicker" is a 2D incremental clicker game where the player collects bread by clicking, purchases upgrades, and automates production to achieve higher levels of efficiency. The game features multiple upgradeable items, passive income mechanics, and a dynamic UI for tracking progress.


## What I Learned

Working on this project helped me expand my knowledge in:
- Managing and scaling UI systems in Unity, including Scroll View and dynamic text updates.
- Writing modular and reusable scripts in C# for game mechanics like upgrades, auto-clickers, and resource management.
- Saving and loading game data using PlayerPrefs to persist player progress.
- Creating and balancing incremental progression systems, including cost scaling and production bonuses.
- Implementing tooltips and interactivity to enhance user experience.
- Organizing large projects and using version control with GitHub.


## Technologies

- **Unity**: For development and 2D game design.
- **C#**: For implementing game logic and interaction.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project management.


## How to Play

1. Click the screen to collect bread.
2. Spend bread to buy upgrades like auto-clickers, bakeries, and factories.
3. Progressively increase production by purchasing higher-tier items.
4. Enjoy passive income as your upgrades automate production.


## Notes
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of game development, particularly in creating progression systems and scaling UI for dynamic content. It marks a significant step forward in my journey as a game developer.
